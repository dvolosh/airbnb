### Overview 
As part of a Business Analytics class, I focused on providing Data Science solutions to Airbnb users and hosts with two main goals:
- Fair Value Estimation - building predictive models to estimate listing prices accurately
- Feature Insights - identifying the most desirable listing features so hosts can make targeted upgrades and improve their ROI

Data Sources:
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata/data) published by Arian Azmoudeh
- [Airbnb Open Data](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) March 2024 New York City

Highlights:
- Using DBSCAN Scan clustering and location data to resolve missing data 
- Analyzing listing names, desciption and deriving naming and policy insights
- Data vizulizations for communicating data, and interactive maps
- Feature engineering and model selection
